# Example kustomization.yaml content.
#
# This file declares the customization provided by
# the kustomize program.
#
# Since customization is, by definition, _custom_,
# there are no sensible default values for the fields
# in this file.
#
# The field values used below are merely examples, not
# to be copied literally.  The values won't work if
# they happen to be references to external files that
# don't exist.
#
# In practice, fields with no value should simply be
# omitted from kustomization.yaml to reduce the content
# visible in configuration reviews.
